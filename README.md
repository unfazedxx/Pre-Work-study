# Kunal's Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

This project was my first attempt at using and implemeting HTML, CSS, JS, and GIT/GITHUB. This page is a studyguide site which will help me retain information and post my thoughts into one specific place. 

- What was your motivation?
    - Motivation for this came from wanting to pursue a new field/industry. By signing up for the bootcamp, it allows me to learn about a new topic, and this is the first step in that process!
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    - i built this project as a way to see how well i can execute on the task at hand, even if it is a new concept. This task took patience and effort but by the end i was happy to see my effort turn into a solid website, all which i created!
- What problem does it solve?
    - the problem at hand was to have somewhere to place my notes for the course at hand, this website solves the problem by providing me one spot, which i have the ability to edit, for all of my notes. 
- What did you learn?
    - i learned a lot. I made many mistakes when it came to GIT push and GIT pull. I learned that there are ways of debugging your code even if it isnt readily available. I also learned that there is so much we can do through coding and with computers, and i am happy to be at the beginning of that journey.
